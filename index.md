### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 part 1 was a favorite because I really appreciated how the lab included pseudocode. It made it much easier to understand what each part of the program was supposed to do before I even started coding. This helped me visualize the steps and structure my code more effectively.
* Lab 4 part 1 was a favorite because this lab focused on converting units, a common task in programming that's also relevant outside of coding. It teaches how to handle everyday measurements in different unit systems. By writing functions for each unit conversion, I learned how to break down a problem into smaller, manageable parts.
* Lab 7 was a favorite because I learned how to translate complex parking rules from street signs into code. I wrote functions that decide if parking is allowed based on different conditions. This is a great example of how to make decisions in software engineer, and how programming can solve everyday problems.
